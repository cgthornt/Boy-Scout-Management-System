Boy Scout Manaement System
==========================
This is a Boy Scout troop management system, written in PHP. I wrote this quite a long time ago, back around 2008. 
I don't think I ever quite implemented it, so here it is online.

Please note that this is NOT UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT. If you want to make changes, feel free to let me do so.
I'm guessing that this has many software vulnerabilities in it yet to be found. So, if you use this, DO SO AT
YOUR OWN RISK. Also, I do not know how well this complies with Boy Scout regulations.

Other notes:

* I'm *NOT* going to provide support on how to install this. If you're looking at this, then I'm assuming that
  you can figure out how to set it up.
* I *think* when I made this that I made my own implementation of a MVC framework :S
* I haven't tested this code before I uploaded
* You might want to change the favicon under ui/img/favicon.png

Have fun!
